# Garbage Classification

## Project Description
This project implements a Garbage Classification system using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The objective is to automatically classify images of garbage into different categories, aiding in efficient recycling and waste management. The notebook demonstrates the full workflow from data preprocessing and model building to training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the image data for model training.
- **Model Building:** Developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify different types of garbage.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Training the model and evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization:** Plotting training curves, confusion matrices, and other key performance indicators.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch, depending on the implementation)
- OpenCV / PIL for image processing
- Scikit-learn for evaluation metrics

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises images of various types of garbage, each labeled according to its category (e.g., plastic, metal, paper, organic). Ensure that the dataset is downloaded and organized appropriately before running the notebook.

## Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Garbage-Classification.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Garbage-Classification
   ```
3. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Launch the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook garbage-classification.ipynb
   ```

## Results & Insights
- Detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the garbage image dataset.
- Step-by-step model development using a CNN.
- Visualizations of model performance and training progress.
- Analysis of classification metrics to assess model effectiveness.
